## Absolute units:
- px , others usually used in printing: cm, in(inch)


## Relative units:
### em and rem:
- 1em is the font-size of an element (or the element’s parent if you’re using it to set font-size). So, for example, if an element’s font-size is 16px, then setting its width to 4em would make its width 64px (16 * 4 == 64).

- 1rem is the font-size of the root element (either :root or html)

### viewport units:

- The units vh and vw relate to the size of the viewport. Specifically, 1vh is equal to 1% of the viewport height and 1vw is equal to 1% of the viewport width.
