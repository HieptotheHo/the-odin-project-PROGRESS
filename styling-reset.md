1. The Meyer Reset is almost certainly the most popular. It’s very simple and basically removes every default style.

2. Normalize.css is another popular one. It’s a little different in that it doesn’t remove all the default styles, but tweaks them slightly to ensure that browsers are consistent. Currently, the article’s download link is dead. If you want to install normalize.css for your project, use the instructions found in the normalize.css repository’s README.md file. If you are unsure which method to use, go with the NPM package install.

3. Reboot, Resets and Reasoning is a CSS tricks article that goes a little more in-depth, and mentions a few other popular resets.

4. Maybe more trivial than useful, this Browser Default Styles site is fun to play with.
